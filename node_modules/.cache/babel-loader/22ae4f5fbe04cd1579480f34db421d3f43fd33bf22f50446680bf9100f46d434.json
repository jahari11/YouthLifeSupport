This enables them to stay informed about conflicts emerging within the community and intervene to resolve them. Additionally, each member of the Street Team is responsible for a caseload of eight (8) individuals identified as Program Participants, who are at high risk of either perpetrating or being victims of shootings. The objective is to connect these individuals with resources aimed at redirecting their behavior, including employment opportunities, vocational and trade training, education, and other supportive services.</p>\r\n                    <p>In situations where proactive intervention is not possible, and a shooting occurs, the Street Team immediately responds by visiting the location of the incident. They engage with community members and contacts with whom they have established relationships to gain insight into the underlying causes of the conflict. This enables them to work with all parties involved to find resolution.In cases of injury resulting from the shooting, the Street Team also visits the hospital, recognizing it as a critical moment where emotions run high. Their objective is to contain, de-escalate, and mediate the conflict to mitigate the likelihood of retaliation. To achieve this, the Street Team collaborates with all parties involved to facilitate conflict resolution.</p>\r\n                    <p>At present, the Street Team comprises three members. However, we anticipate receiving additional funding this year, enabling us to expand the team's coverage to more areas.

These components enable frontline officers to refer individuals confronting mental health, poverty, homelessness, or related challenges away from the criminal justice system. Qualified participants, upon agreement, are enrolled by our Outreach & Intake Coordinator, leading to charge dismissal upon successful completion, while also providing alternative pathways for accessing our program without police involvement.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className='program0-img'>\r\n              <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1664575197593-2e7085ef086b?q=80&w=3870&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D\" alt='photo'/>\r\n              <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573497491208-6b1acb260507?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D\" alt=\"\" />\r\n              <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507537362848-9c7e70b7b5c1?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"program0txt\">\r\n                    <div className='program0txt-col'>\r\n                    <p><span className='bold'>Social Contact Referrals</span> serve as a means for community partners and stakeholders to suggest individuals who meet our program's criteria and could gain from joining. Once they fill out a referral form on our website and it's approved by the Project Manager, our Outreach & Intake Coordinator steps in to make contact and guide enrollment. This process closely resembles the one mentioned earlier but differs in that it doesn't involve law enforcement since there's no criminal activity involved.</p>\r\n                    <p><span className='bold'>Community Contact Referral</span> provides an opportunity for community members or neighbors to recommend individuals who meet our program's criteria and could benefit from participation. By completing a referral form on our website and receiving approval from the Project Manager, our Outreach & Intake Coordinator initiates contact and facilitates enrollment, mirroring the process outlined previously. Notably, this avenue does not involve law enforcement, as there is no criminal activity.</p>\r\n                    <p><span className='bold'>Self-Referral</span> allows individuals who have learned about our program and its level of engagement to approach program staff seeking support for themselves. In this scenario, the Outreach & Intake Coordinator meets with the individual to complete initial paperwork and schedules an appointment with a Case Manager. The Case Manager then guides the individual through the process and connects them with the necessary services.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className='program0txt-col'>\r\n                    <div className='program0-s'>\r\n                      <h3>There are three components to the program that are the basis for its success.

This group includes representatives from the Schenectady County Sheriff’s Office, Schenectady City Police Department, County Manager District Attorney Office, Office Of the Public Defender, County Department Of Health, Department of Social Services, The Galesi Group, The Melozzi Group, and Youth L.I.F.E. Support Network, Inc. Together, they oversee program operations and convene monthly to ensure its effectiveness.</p>\r\n                    <p>The <span className='bold'>The Operation Work Group (OWG)</span> plays a pivotal role within the PCG framework by regularly assessing individual cases of program enrollees to gauge effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. Through these bi-weekly reviews, the OWG aims to enhance participant outcomes and promote sustained stability. Furthermore, the group actively engages in policy discussions to adapt and refine strategies that align with the evolving needs of the program's diverse population, thereby fostering an environment conducive to participant success and overall program efficacy.</p>\r\n                    <p>The <span className='bold'>Community Engagement Coordinator(s)</span> who are responsible for educating the community as a whole (community members, neighborhood associations, faith-based groups, mental health providers, substance use agencies, businesses, chambers of commerce, bodegas, super markets, etc.) about the program with the goal of building up a base and network of support to have in place as resources for the men and women that the program will be working with. This coalition/collaboration group is called the <span className='bold'>Community Leadership Team</span> and is managed by the Community Engagement Coordinator(s). The Community Leadership Team meets frequently and is updated on the progress and challenges met with respect to persons that the Case Managers are working with to be sure that all known resources are

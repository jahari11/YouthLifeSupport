The Community Transition Coach also reaches out to the community supports (significant other, parent(s), child(ren), spiritual representative, friend, etc.) mentioned during the discharge planning to strengthen or reconnect those relationships so that the men/women leaving have a solid safety net in place upon their release. Once the person is released from confinement, the Community Transition & Reintegration Coach also does in-person and phone check-ins as a support to be sure that the released individual knows that support is always available.</p>\r\n                <p>There are Tier I and Tier II Counselors who meet with those interested in counseling while they are confined, which is also continued upon and after their release. Tier I Counselors meet with individuals who are dealing with lighter issues such as: difficulty adjusting with the environment, usually those confined for their first time; high stress due to the challenge of maintaining their relationship(s) due to being confined; situational anxiety, etc. Tier II Counselors meet with individuals presenting with deeper issues such as depression, uncontrolled anger, loss of a loved one during confinement or a recent loss that the person is still having a difficult time processing on his/her own, etc. Again, these supports are extended even once the time of confinement has ended, and the person is released back to their family.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ProgramTitles"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAEzB,MAAMC,aAAa,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EAC1B,oBACED,OAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,eACIF,OAAA;MAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;MAAAD,QAAA,gBAChCF,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACvBF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAC1BF,OAAA;YAAKI,GAAG,EAAC,wKAAwK;YAACC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAE;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAC3LT,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,cAAc;YAAAD,QAAA,gBAC3BF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAAoD;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7DT,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAA6U;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACjV,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACxBF,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAA8Z;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACraT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAAugB;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9gBT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAA0wB;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACjxBT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAAq8B;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC58BT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAAg0B;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACt0B,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACvBF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAC1BF,OAAA;YAAKI,GAAG,EAAC,wKAAwK;YAACC,GAAG,EAAC;UAAE;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eAC3LT,OAAA;YAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,cAAc;YAAAD,QAAA,gBAC3BF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAAoD;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7DT,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;YAA6U;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACjV,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACxBF,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAA8Z;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACraT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAAugB;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9gBT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAA0wB;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACjxBT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAAq8B;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC58BT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAAg0B;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACt0B,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH;EAAC;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACL,CAAC;AAEV,CAAC;AAAAC,EAAA,GAvCKT,aAAa;AAyCnB,eAAeA,aAAa;AAAA,IAAAS,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}

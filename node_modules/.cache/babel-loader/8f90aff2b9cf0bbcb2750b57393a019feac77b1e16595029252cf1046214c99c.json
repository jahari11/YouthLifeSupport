These components enable frontline officers to refer individuals confronting mental health, poverty, homelessness, or related challenges away from the criminal justice system. Qualified participants, upon agreement, are enrolled by our Outreach & Intake Coordinator, leading to charge dismissal upon successful completion, while also providing alternative pathways for accessing our program without police involvement.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className='program0-img'>\r\n              <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1664575197593-2e7085ef086b?q=80&w=3870&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D\" alt='photo'/>\r\n              <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573497491208-6b1acb260507?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D\" alt=\"\" />\r\n              <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507537362848-9c7e70b7b5c1?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"program0txt\">\r\n                    <div className='program0txt-col'>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                    <p><span className='bold'>Social Contact Referrals</span> serve as a means for community partners and stakeholders to suggest individuals who meet our program's criteria and could gain from joining.
